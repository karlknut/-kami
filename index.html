              <h5 class="s-four__h5">
                  The S-four system supports Ōkami's price stability by reducing the attractiveness of serial selling.
                  This works by consecutively increasing the sell cool down period (See below illustration).
                  Once a user activates their first sell, they must wait 1 hour until they can sell again. Their second sell then takes 2 hours.
                  Third sell is then 6 hours until their fourth sell being 12 hours. Here at Ōkami we believe we can maintain and simply grow our pack,
                  but we also understand some holders may want to release some Ōkami from their pack.
                  This is healthy in crypto but can be taken advantage of by whales which is why we once again must reinforce that with this process in place these whales,
                  who we at Ōkami wish to avoid as much as possible can be put off by this system in place.

              </a>
              <h5 class="pip__h5">
                  A further system that we believe can reduce whale impact is by engineering Ōkami to limit sell amounts, whereby only allowing a maximum of 3% price impact.
                  Ōkami team members have personally experienced the horror of understanding that a whale has been able to drop the price of a project by huge percentages
                  from a single sell which makes the crypto project itself seem disingenuous when in fact they were just at the mercy of a merciless whale.<br /> <br />
                  Redistribution tax - When wolves decide to go their own way and disband from the Ōkami Pack, we tax on sells,
                  in which the fees get redistributed to the rest of the Ōkami's. Check out the illustration on the right hand side to familiarise yourself with the mechanics.
